Ship Detection in Satellite Imagery üõ∞Ô∏è
This project focuses on detecting ships in satellite imagery using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes images labeled for the presence of ships. The project utilizes Python and the CatBoost algorithm for training a classification model that can distinguish between images with and without ships.
The dataset used is from Kaggle: Ships in Satellite Imagery.
